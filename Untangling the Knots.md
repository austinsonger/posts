The United States has imposed a wide range of economic sanctions on Venezuela, including sanctions on the state-owned oil company PDVSA, the financial sector, and government officials. The stated goal of these sanctions is to pressure the Maduro government to step down, but they have also had a significant impact on the Venezuelan economy and people.

The most significant impact of US sanctions has been on Venezuela's oil exports. Oil is Venezuela's main source of revenue, and the sanctions have made it difficult for the country to sell its oil. This has led to a sharp decline in oil production and revenue, which has exacerbated Venezuela's economic crisis.

In 2017, Venezuela's oil production was 1.9 million barrels per day. By 2022, it had fallen to just 700,000 barrels per day. This decline in production has led to a significant loss of revenue for the Venezuelan government. In 2017, Venezuela earned $22 billion from oil exports. By 2022, that figure had fallen to just $6 billion.

The decline in oil revenue has had a devastating impact on the Venezuelan economy. The country has experienced hyperinflation, widespread shortages of goods and services, and a humanitarian crisis. In 2022, the poverty rate in Venezuela was over 90%.

The US sanctions have also made it difficult for Venezuela to import goods and services, including food and medicine. This has led to shortages of essential goods and services, and has made it difficult for Venezuelans to meet their basic needs.

In 2022, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that 25% of Venezuelans were facing severe food insecurity. This means that they did not have access to enough food to meet their basic needs.

Moreover, Venezuela's healthcare system has been devastated by the sanctions. The country is facing shortages of medical supplies and equipment, and there is a shortage of doctors and nurses. This has made it difficult for Venezuelans to access healthcare.

These economic and humanitarian crises have catalyzed a mass exodus from Venezuela. The US sanctions have also led to a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, with millions of Venezuelans fleeing the country in recent years, seeking better economic opportunities and access to basic necessities. The sanctions have also made it difficult for humanitarian aid to reach Venezuela.

In 2022, the UN estimated that over 6 million Venezuelans had fled the country. This is one of the largest displacement crises in the world.

Many of the Venezuelans who have fled the country have gone to neighboring countries, such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. These countries are struggling to cope with the influx of Venezuelan refugees.

**Untangling The Snarl**

**Revisiting Economic Sanctions**: A pivotal stride towards aiding Venezuela's recovery would be revisiting the economic sanctions that have shackled its economy. Easing sanctions, particularly on the oil sector, could revitalize Venezuela’s main revenue source, thereby fueling economic recovery. As the Venezuelan economy stabilizes, the desperate need for citizens to migrate in search of better economic opportunities may diminish.

**Promoting Trade and Investment**: Encouraging trade and investments could be another avenue. By lifting trade restrictions and promoting foreign investments, the U.S can help rejuvenate the Venezuelan economy. A booming economy could offer employment opportunities and improved living standards for Venezuelans, which in turn could curb the urgency to migrate.

**Humanitarian Aid and Development Assistance**: Offering humanitarian aid and development assistance without political strings could significantly alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people. By addressing the humanitarian crisis and supporting infrastructure and societal development, the U.S. could help create a more stable and prosperous Venezuela, reducing the compelling reasons for migration.

**Supporting Democratic Discourse**: Engaging in constructive diplomatic dialogue that supports democratic discourse, rather than overtly backing opposition factions, can contribute to political stability. A more stable political landscape could restore citizens’ confidence in their nation’s future, potentially reducing the desire to seek refuge elsewhere.

**Regional Cooperation**: Fostering regional cooperation to address Venezuela’s challenges could also play a crucial role. Engaging with neighboring countries and regional bodies to create a supportive network could significantly aid Venezuela’s recovery efforts.

As these measures help in stabilizing Venezuela's economic and political landscape, the push factors driving Venezuelans to undertake perilous journeys northwards would likely abate. Moreover, a constructive and compassionate approach towards Venezuela could also enhance the U.S.’s image in the region, painting a picture of a nation willing to extend a helping hand amidst adversity.

The US sanctions on Venezuela are having a devastating impact on the Venezuelan economy and people. The sanctions are making it difficult for Venezuela to sell its oil, import goods and services, and provide healthcare for its citizens. The sanctions have also led to a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.

The US government should reconsider its sanctions policy on Venezuela. The sanctions are not achieving their stated goal of pressuring the Maduro government to step down. Instead, they are only hurting the Venezuelan people.
